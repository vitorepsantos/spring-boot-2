# AOP Aspect Oriented Programming
AOP is a programming paradigm that aims to increase modularity by allowing the separation of cross-cutting concerns.
It does so by adding additional behavior to existing code without modification of the code itself. [1]

Instead, we can declare this new code and these new behaviors separately. [1]

Spring's AOP framework helps us implement these cross-cutting concerns. [1]
